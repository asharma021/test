Pulse automation Test Alignment
In my role supporting the Pulse Automation Testing Alignment Path goal, I helped transition Pulse QScore testing to an automated framework. I developed, implemented, and maintained automated test cases, streamlining the testing process and enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. By aligning testing practices with automation, I contributed to improved performance, quality, and a stronger financial impact for the testing function, much like my work on the DQ Pulse Dashboard.

Scale and Organisational Goal

This approach enhanced testing’s contribution to financial performance by supporting scalable, reliable processes across the technology organization.

Client and Franchise

In my role, I supported the goal to simplify business processes, strengthen controls, and improve data quality within testing, directly contributing to organizational productivity and enhancing the client experience. By focusing on Price Risk and the Finance Data Quality program, as well as regulatory commitments, I ensured that testing aligned with Citi’s Data Operating Model. This included implementing Data Lineage, verifying Authoritative Data Sources, supporting Data Ownership, and validating Data Modeling practices. My work allowed Citi to demonstrate effective data governance while providing transparency into data health, ensuring actionable insights from well-governed, high-quality data.
